<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Credit Union 1 Member,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At Credit Union 1 , 
  the highest responsability to our customer is the safekeeping of confidential 
  information you have entrusted to us and using it in a responsable manner. A 
  fundamental element of safeguarding your confidential information is to provide 
  protection against unauthorized access or use of this information. We maintain 
  physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal guidelines 
  to guard your nonpublic personal information against unauthorized access. Our 
  mission is to reduce the instance of fraud.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As a public service, 
  our bank enables any individual, anywhere in the world, to check your credit 
  card to see whether or not your card, and possibly your identity, have become 
  compromised.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A frequent question 
  we get is "where do you get compromised credit cards and personal identities 
  from?" Credit Union 1 uses its proprietary search bot, guided by the field 
  intelligence, to roam the internet's newsgroups, search engines, and chat rooms 
  looking for insecure credit card and personally identifiable consumer information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this computer 
  age, our personal information is stored on countless databases, on servers which 
  are either directly connected to the internet or indirectly via internal computer 
  networks. Some or all of your financial information is stored by: banks, employers, 
  the IRS, credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax,Cyber Banch and TransUnion), Doctors, Health 
  Insurance providers, Universities, marketing lists, and potentially anywhere 
  you've ever paid for anything with a check or credit card (online & offline). 
  Additionally, bits of your financial information are generated every day, in 
  the form of: your name and address from piece of junk mail, a restaurant receipt 
  with your credit card number, ATM receipts, credit card bills, bank statements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At this time we 
  need you to confirm your identity with our existing database and prevent fraudulent 
  use of your financial information. As soon as our database will be confirmed 
  we need to make some important anouncements to our customers so please confirm 
  your identity with no delay. Please click on the link below to start the process:</font></p>
