<FONT color=3Dblue><strong> Dear Valued PayPal Member</strong></FONT>,<br>=

<br>During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we =

al.<br> This might be due to either following reasons:
<br> 
<br><strong><FONT color=3Dred>- A recent change in your personal informati=
on (i.e. change of address)</FONT>
<br><FONT color=3Dred>- An inability to accurately verify your selected op=
tion of payment due an internal error within
our processors.</FONT></strong>
<br>
<br>Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to =

confirm your identity in
order to regain full privileges of your account.
<br>However, failure to update your records will result in account suspens=
ion.<br><br>
