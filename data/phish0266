<br><br>We have recently noticed one or more attempts to log into your PayPal account from a 
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account may have been hijacked

may have been initiated by you.
However, if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link below to log into your account within the above-mentioned period. <br><br><br><a href="http://80.247.201.9/.paypal/"

<br>If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporarily suspend 
your account.<br><br>
We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the case to be investigated and we
strongly recommend to verify your account in that time.
